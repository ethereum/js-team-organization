# EF JavaScript Team Roadmap 2025

Status: `DRAFT`
Latest Update: `2024-10-24`

This document reflects our initial planning for the respective year and represents
the roadmap we have submitted internally within the EF.

## Overview

### The EF JavaScript Team

The EF JavaScript team consists of 7 team members and is currently led by [Holger Drewes](https://github.com/holgerd77).
It is historically grown out of the - initially - community driven work on an Ethereum L1 protocol stack implemented in
`JavaScript` for Node.js and browser usage, called [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo).
Over the years this stack matured a lot and with its modular nature (all 15 libraries can be used in isolation) it now
serves as a robust platform for both production usage of activated L1 Ethereum Mainnet technologies and applied EIP research and
protocol testing.

A second strain of development is the work on a JavaScript (respectively nowadays, goes for EthereumJS as well: `TypeScript`)
implementation of the [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) specifications, an evolving
set of distributed and specialized networks for Ethereum data needs (history, state, beacon,...). The
[Ultralight](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ultralight) client is actively used for Portal Network research and will likely
find its way into the broader EthereumJS library stack over time.

### Tracks

The roadmap is divided into the following "tracks", identifying our main focus areas
for the year. Note that these tracks are slighly adopted by year, aligning with our focus areas evolving and shifting over time.

Also note that 2025 is the first year where we do not break down roadmap milestones per quarter any more since our main focus
has significantly shifted to be more (applied) research focused and a general breakdown of deliverables now feels more adequate
to align with the wider degrees of freedom the team now works within.

## Secure Pure JS Browser EVM & Browser Support

Track responsible: [Holger Drewes](https://github.com/holgerd77)

While the EthereumJS library suite was meant to also be used in the browser from the beginning, the way towards a fully usable
Ethereum L1 browser stack was long and stony. Underlying crypto bindings for C language implementations needed to be replaced
first by Web Assembly (WASM) builds, then by pure JS implementations. Node.js specific "Buffer" usage went away for JS-native
`Uint8Array`, library size and dependencies needed to be driven down significantly to be efficiently "loadable" by browsers,
and a whole new JS module system called [ESM](https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm) (in contrast
to `CJS`) needed to establish itself first to allow for refactor our libraries so that the code is fully interchangeable 
between browser and Node.js without the need of further processing steps. All these steps took several years to materialize.

The November 2024 [EthereumJS breaking releases](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/3722) mark the first
time where the Ethereum L1 protocol stack is now fully available to the browser and directly usable without any major 
restrictions or usability hurdles.

In 2025 we want to build upon this asset: especially the [EVM](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/evm)
is now JavaScript only (no C-bindings, no Web Assembly (WASM) code) and is now fully prepared to be used in security-sensitive
contexts (e.g. with the upcoming [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) account abstraction) with the full code
being readable (and so: auditable) in under 15 minutes (including *all* dependencies, see e.g. [this](https://gist.github.com/holgerd77/2c032488196b4afee5d976dc85ee70eb) Gist for illustration).

So there are new, broader and potentially more serious browser use cases on the horizon.

### 2025 Deliverables

- EthereumJS EVM/VM third-party audit
- Community support for browser integration
- Browser showcases for L1 protocol work
- Generally raise community awareness

## Verkle Development & Testing

Track responsible: [Gabriel Rocheleau](https://github.com/gabrocheleau)

Verkle specs have matured a lot in 2024 and a Verkle or Verkle-properties containing tree structure is now planned to be integrated within the short term upcoming hardfork lineup. Our team is actively engaged in Verkle development and we have a 
[stateless Verkle implementation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/statemanager#statelessverklestatemanager-experimental) ready for some time which we use to join [verkle testnets](https://github.com/ethpandaops/verkle-devnets) to help to test and evolve the verkle specification (see e.g. [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/verkle-gen-devnet-6)
for an overview).

Throughout the year we have done additional work to make the interfaces within the libraries more tree-agnostic (so: that it does not matter if a Merkle or Verkle tree is used) and brought our own [verkle tree implementation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/verkle) to the point where we now can do stateful verkle execution.

Together with the new test generation capabilities for the [cross client tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/verkle%40v0.0.5) in `execution-spec-tests` we have gained (see "Protocol Testing" track) we have now everything together to support Verkle development on a
broader level.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Continued early-on spec implementations and feedback
- Help setup and run stateless verkle testnets
- Provide a JavaScript verkle trie implementation, along with proof verification and generation
- Allow stateful verkle block execution
- Continuous verkle test generation for [ethereum-execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs)
- Active contributions to work on verkle test coverage and fill tests

## Stateless Verkle Client & Modularization

Track responsible: [Amir Ghorbanian](https://github.com/scorbajio)

Stateless will make (parts of) a browser based/used client more viable. We have all the building blocks together (Verkle, VM, client) to serve software components for this use case. 2025 will be the year where we can bundle all existing pieces together respectively refactor in a way so that browser applications will be able to integrate lightweight verkle block verification into their code base. This will allow developers to build their dApps in a more trustworthy way by rely on less 3rd party trust assumptions.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Modularization of the EthereumJS client code
- App -> Library: reusage/integration into existing code bases
- Strong client dependency reduction to prepare for production use cases
- Verkle-tailored stateless client version of the client
- Work on outer UX experience

## Portal Network & EIP-4444

Track resonsible: [Scotty Poi](https://github.com/ScottyPoi)

The [Portal network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) is on-track to deliver the production MVP of its three initial networks by the end of 2024.

 - The History Network is is largely feature complete and considered to be in "production" status and ready for adoption as a source for providing chain history in an [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444) context.
 - The Portal Beacon network is also largely feature complete
 - The Portal State network is in active development across portal client teams.  The initial phase of this network is currently being tested in a live production environment.

The Javascript team plays a key role in Portal Network development through the [Ultralight](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ultralight) Portal Client, and direct contributions to the protocol design.  

 - Ultralight is a spec compliant Portal Client that is being developed by the Javascript team.  
 - Ultralight is currently in active development and is being used to test the Portal Network in the [Portal Hive Tests](https://portal-hive.ethdevops.io/).
 - The Javascript team operates and maintains 15 public bootnodes active on all live Portal Networks (History, Beacon, State).
 - Ultralight and the EthereumJS Client are in the initial phases of integration, and are on-track to be the first example of an Execution Client using Portal for EIP-4444 and beyond. 
 - Ultralight is also currently integrating the EthereumJS
EVM and other libraries, giving it state execution capabilities using only the Portal Networks.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Help with continued development of [Portal network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) specs.
- Prototyping of EIP-4444 integration of EthereumJS Client and Ultralight code
- Integration of EthereumJS EVM and other libraries into Ultralight
- Maintain and operate public bootnodes for all active Portal Networks
- Activation of "bridge" nodes to pump content into networks
- Explore/work on advanced Portal networks (for Verkle e.g.)
- Explore possibility of browser, mobile, and WebRTC based clients

## Applied EIP/HF Development

Track responsible: [Andrew Day](https://github.com/acolytec3)

We are in a position for quite some time now where we can provide implementations of new EIPs considered for upcoming hardforks relatively early on due to our modular build-up stack (we can basically directly merge new EIPs in without affecting production code). This work is done to give the JavaScript developer community access to high-quality implementations of up-to-date Ethereum mainnet building blocks (e.g. to integrate into dApps or JavaScript-based developer tooling) as well as to join or help setting up cross-client developer test networks (like the `pectra-devnet-x` network series).

2025 will likely be a year with continued (and eventually: rising) demands regarding new Ethereum feature integration and it is therefore expected that we will continue to put a solid amount of ressources into EIP development work.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Continued EIP integration & refinement for the upcoming Pectra hardfork
- Some special development focus and protocol feedback on EOF
- Start with Osaka hardfork EIP development work
- Strengthen relationships with browser/JavaScript based developer tools (Remix, evm.tools, TEVM,...) to foster early-on EIP integration
- Own selected browser-based EIP community showcases

## Protocol Testing

Track responsible: [Jochem Brouwer](https://github.com/jochem-brouwer)

Building upon our active EIP and HF developement and our previous cross-client testing experiences we have now finished the integration of our VM into the new [execution-spec-tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/) cross-client testing environment in late 2024 (see PR [#3603](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/3603)).

We have build up some first test case creation experience afterward, culminating in the filling of the [pectra-devnet-4](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/pectra-devnet-4%40v1.0.0) tests with the EthereumJS based integration.

In 2025 we plan to build upon this experiences and become a regular test case contributor.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Continued test filling support
- Establish in "team DNA" to create tests cases on a regular basis
- Active test creation work in selected areas (EOF, 7702,...)
- More structured approach on test coverage / edge case detection

## Research Prototyping

Track responsible: [Gajinder Singh](https://github.com/g11tech)

For the same reasons of our stack being quite modular and extensive, the EthereumJS libraries are well suited to do early-on research prototyping. In 2024 we have leveraged this by realizing an extensive prototype implementing a research snapshot around the work on:
- a new SSZ-based transaction format ([EIP-6404](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-6404.md)) as well as a corresponding signature scheme ([EIP-6493](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-6493.md))
- additional SSZ-ification side EIPs (like [EIP-6466](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6466)
- further enabling proofing capabilities (like [EIP-7792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7792), [EIP-7708](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7708))

The prototype from PR [#3756](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/3756) was then use to test the new format in a research testnet environment to give early on insight in feasibility and live-network behavior.

### 2025 Deliverables

For 2025 the extensive SSZ transaction / stable container work outlined will likely continue. While there are no concrete additional research prototyping projects imminent, it is pretty likely that these will appear on stage and we are open to specic requests in this direction from within the EF.
