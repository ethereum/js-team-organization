# EF JavaScript Team Roadmap 2025

This document reflects our initial planning for the respective year and represents
the roadmap we have submitted internally within the EF.

## Overview

### The EF JavaScript Team

The EF JavaScript team consists of 7 team members and is currently led by [Holger Drewes](https://github.com/holgerd77).
It is historically grown out of the - initially - community driven work on an Ethereum L1 protocol stack implemented in
`JavaScript` for Node.js and browser usage, called [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo).
Over the years this stack matured a lot and with it's modular nature (all 15 libraries can be used in isolation) it now
serves as a robust platform for both productive usage of activated L1 Ethereum Mainnet technolgies and applied EIP research and
protocol testing.

A second strain of development is the work on a JavaScript (respectively nowadays, goes for EthereumJS as well: `TypeScript`)
implementation of the [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) specifications, an evolving
set of distributed and specialized networks for Ethereum data needs (history, state, beacon,...). The
[Ultralight](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ultralight) client is actively used for Portal Network research and will likely
find its way into the broader EthereumJS library stack over time.

### Tracks

The roadmap is divided into the following "tracks", identifying our main focus areas
for the year. Note that these tracks are slighly adopted by year, aligning with our focus areas evolving and shifting over time.

Also note that 2025 is the first year where we do not break down roadmap milestones per quarter any more since our main focus
has significantly shifted to be more (applied) research focused and a general breakdown of deliverables now feels more adequate
to align with the wider degrees of freedom the team now works within.

## Secure Pure JS Browser EVM & Browser Support

Track responsible: [Holger Drewes](https://github.com/holgerd77)

While the EthereumJS library suite was meant to also be used in the browser from the beginning, the way towards a fully usable
Ethereum L1 browser stack was long and stony. Underlying crypto bindings for C language implementations needed to be replaced
first by Web Assembly (WASM) builds, then by pure JS implementations. Node.js specific "Buffer" usage went away for JS-native
`Uint8Array`, library size and dependencies needed to be driven down significantly to be efficiently "loadable" by browsers,
and a whole new JS module system called [ESM](https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm) (in contrast
to `CJS`) needed to establish itself first to allow for refactor our libraries so that the code is fully interchangeable 
between browser and Node.js without the need of further processing steps. All these steps took several years to materialize.

The November 2024 [EthereumJS breaking releases](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/3722) mark the first
time where the Ethereum L1 protocol stack is now fully available to the browser and directly usable without any major 
restrictions or usability hurdles.

In 2025 we want to build upon this asset: especially the [EVM](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/evm)
is now JavaScript only (no C-bindings, no Web Assembly (WASM) code) and is now fully prepared to be used in security-sensitive
contexts (e.g. with the upcoming [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) account abstraction) with the full code
being readable (and so: auditable) in under 15 minutes (including *all* dependencies, see e.g. [this](https://gist.github.com/holgerd77/2c032488196b4afee5d976dc85ee70eb) Gist for illustration).

So there are new, broader and potentially more serious browser use cases on the horizon.

### 2025 Deliverables

- EthereumJS EVM/VM third-party audit
- Community support for browser integration
- Browser showcases for L1 protocol work
- Generally raise community awareness

## Verkle Development & Testing

Track responsible: [Gabriel Rocheleau](https://github.com/gabrocheleau)

Verkle specs have matured a lot in 2024 and a Verkle or Verkle-properties containing tree structure is now planned to be integrated 
within the short term upcoming hardfork lineup. Our team is actively engaged in Verkle development and we have a 
[stateless Verkle implementation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/statemanager#statelessverklestatemanager-experimental) ready for some time which we use to join [verkle testnets](https://github.com/ethpandaops/verkle-devnets) to help to test and evolve the verkle specification (see e.g. [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/verkle-gen-devnet-6)
for an overview).

Throughout the year we have done additional work to make the interfaces within the libraries more tree-agnostic (so: that it does not matter
if a Merkle or Verkle tree is used) and brought our own [verkle tree implementation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/verkle) to the point where we now can do stateful verkle execution.

Together with the new test generation capabilities for the [cross client tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/verkle%40v0.0.5) in `execution-spec-tests` we have gained (see "Protocol Testing" track) we have now everything together to support Verkle development on a
broader level.

### 2025 Deliverables

- Continued early-on spec implementations and feedback
- Help setup and run stateless verkle testnets
- Continuous verkle test generation for [ethereum-execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs)
- Active contributions to work on verkle test coverage and fill tests
