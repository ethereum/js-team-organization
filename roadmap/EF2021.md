# EF JavaScript Team Roadmap 2021

This document reflects our initial planning for the respective year and respresents
the roadmap we have submitted internally within the EF.

Things in the Ethereum ecosystem move quicky, so please note that we will likely deviate
substantially from this initial roadmap throughout the year.

See our "live" [roadmap](./README.md) document for an up-to-date overview on what we
are currently up to.

## Q1

- DevEx: VM structural Benchmark CI Integration
- DevEx: VM local performance improvements (algorithm rewrites, caching)
- DevEx: Merkle Patricia Tree Refactoring (readability, performance)

- Client: Client state downloader
- Client: Developer API Draft
- Client: Beam Sync (Head State) Draft Implementation
- Client/Networking: ETH/65 Implementation

- Stateless: VM Stateless Execution

- Research & Consensus: Client Yolo v2 Testnet
- Research & Consensus: 2-3 Berlin/post-Berlin EIP implementations

- Ethers: Issue triage; ethers v5 is done, with no new large features planned, so closing off discussions and verifying there are no outstanding bugs will be the focus
- Ethers: Replacing elliptic/bn.js; this will likely spill over into Q2 along with v6
- Ethers: This is in parallel with v6 changes and preparation

- Team: 1 new full-time or part-time hire

## Q2

- DevEx: VM structural performance improvements I (module rewrites, build changes)
- DevEx: EthereumJS Documentation Consolidation, Versioning
- DevEx: TypeScript Type Improvements

- Client: Beam Sync (Head State) Performance Optimizations
- Client: First Developer Release
- Client/Networking: ETH/66 Implementation

- Stateless: Alexandria Chain History Network Experimentation
- Stateless, Networking: Witness Protocol wit/0 Draft Implementation, https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/pull/167

- Research & Consensus: Yolo v3 Testnet
- Research & Consensus: VM EIP-1559 Implementation
- Research & Consensus: Client EIP-1559 Testnet
- Research & Consensus: 2-3 Berlin/post-Berlin EIP implementations


- Ethers: v6: this will be a fairly major overhaul. currently ethers supports 10+ year old browsers and 4+ year old node.js. By moving to ES2015 a lot of support for ancient browsers and node will be impacted, but being able to use more recent JavaScript features will greatly improve developer UX and security (e.g. Proxy will make Contract interaction amazing!)
- Ethers: TypeScript features; as part of v6, a lot of new TypeScript features can be used (any vs unknown, strict null checks, complex union types); these are backwards incompatible, but will improve the safety of developers using ethers by providing more robust error checking

- Team: 1 new full-time or part-time hire

## Q3

- DevEx: VM structural performance improvements II (WASM)
- DevEx: BigInt Support

- Client: Beam Sync (Head State) Support
- Client: Developer Use Case Evaluation, Continued Development, API Refinement

- Stateless: Alexandria Chain History Network Draft Implementation
- Stateless: Binary Trie Implementation (https://ethresear.ch/t/binary-trie-format/7621)
- Stateless: VM Code Merkelization Integration

- Research & Consensus: 2-3 post-Berlin EIP implementations

- Ethers: Test Coverage; currently at 80%, with v6 I would like to focus a lot more time on ensuring all code paths are tested, especially rarer paths
- Ethers: Depending on the state of eth2, a new class of providers may be justified along with BLS signing keys

- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: VM Eth 2.0 Integration Draft (opcode updates, outer structure)
- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: TX, Block Structural Updates Draft
- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: Blockchain Consensus Model Update Draft
- Eth 2.0: Lodestar <-> EthereumJS Client Bridge Feasibility Analysis

## Q4

- Research & Consensus: 2-3 Berlin/post-Berlin EIP implementations
- Research & Consensus: VM EVM384 EVM Crypto Extension Implementation

- Ethers: documentation; Q4 is far away, but documentation is always in need of improvement ðŸ™‚

- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: VM Eth 2.0 Integration Implementation (opcode updates, outer structure)
- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: TX, Block Structural Updates Implementation
- Eth 2.0: Execution Layer: Blockchain Consensus Model Update Implementation
- Eth 2.0: Lodestar <-> EthereumJS Client Bridge Draft
