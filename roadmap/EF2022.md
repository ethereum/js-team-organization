# EF JavaScript Team Roadmap 2022

This document reflects our initial planning for the respective year and represents
the roadmap we have submitted internally within the EF.

Things in the Ethereum ecosystem move quickly, so please note that we will likely deviate
substantially from this initial roadmap throughout the year.

See our "live" [roadmap](./README.md) document for an up-to-date overview on what we
are currently up to.

## Tracks

The roadmap is divided into the following "tracks", identifying our main focus areas
for the year.

### DevEx & VM

The [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries are often used in a development context, being as it is an integral part of main Ethereum developer tools or as building blocks for browser UIs of decentralized applications (dApps). Improving the experience when working with our libraries is therefore a crucial part of our work, with the VM playing a special role here due to the central place it takes in development tools like Hardhat, Truffle or Remix.

### Hardforks & EIPs

Implementing hardforks and providing early-on access to the added or changed functionality in development tools takes a reoccurring share in our work. We also do selected implementations of dedicated EIPs not yet "hardfork-settled" where it makes sense.

### Research & Client

The JavaScript team takes part in Ethereum protocol-related research especially in areas where possible future applications in a TypeScript/JavaScript/Web Browser context are on the horizon, going "stateless" is a good example here since it is desirable to have lightweight browser access to the Ethereum network. We use our EthereumJS [client implementation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client) here as a research leveraging tool and as a testbed. 

### Portal Network

The [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) is a new peer-to-peer network topology for the Ethereum network (like devp2p) being built to allow for lightweight Ethereum (mainnet) protocol access and expose a JSON-RPC like interface along. The effort is led by [Piper Merriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam) and progress has been substantially advanced with specs laid out on a detailed level and two client implementations (Trin [Rust] and Fluffy [Nim]) underway.

The EF JavaScript team has built a [prototype](https://github.com/acolytec3/portalnetwork) of this in 2021 to test its feasibility. We will expand on this in 2022 with dedicated hires to build up an SDK in TypeScript/JavaScript which will allow bringing portal network functionality to the browser and other Javascript environments to allow direct integration into dapps and wallet providers.

### Ethers.js

The [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) library is one of the most popular connector and wallet libraries used to and interact with the Ethereum network. Primarily maintained by [Richard Moore](https://github.com/ricmoo) the library is downloaded by far over 1 million users and developers each month. To further develop and maintain the library is therefore crucial to support the large community which has grown around the library over the years.

The following planning is based on the following theoretical assumptions on an outer timeline (note that there is no evidence or public statements that these dates will happen to any extend):

- "The Merge" happening in spring 2022
- Shanghai HF happening around summer 2022
- Stateless happening somewhat after "The Merge"

## Q1

### DevEx & VM

- [ ] Continued L2 Support Improvements (Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum,...)
- [ ] ZK Rollup L2 Solution Support Analysis
- [ ] VM Support Feasibility Analysis for EVM equivalent L2 Solutions (e.g. Optimism)
- [ ] Deeper reaching VM performance optimizations Part I (Memory optimizations, Buffer, Algorithms)
- [ ] 1 additional VM hire

### Hardforks & EIPs

- [ ] Production-ready Merge releases of VM and other libraries
- [ ] First Shanghai HF EIP implementations (scope still open)
- [ ] EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction
- [ ] EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode
- [ ] EIP-4488: Transaction calldata gas cost reduction with total calldata limit

### Research & Client

- [ ] Client Mainnet Sync Improvements (Shanghai dDoS blocks, -> VM/Trie performance, caching)
- [ ] Verkle Demo Network (Stateless block execution EthereumJS Client) (Project with Geth, Guillaume Ballet, others)
- [ ] 1 dedicated ZK expert hire

### Portal Network

- [ ] Structural Setup (Monorepo, Software Tests, CI, Code Cleanup)
- [ ] Robustness of the networking layer (`portalnetwork` module)
- [ ] Draft implementation for 1-2 sub networks (e.g. state / history)
- [ ] Analysis on browser networking topology
- [ ] Small-scale browser syncing/communication experiments
- [ ] 1-2 additional hires for the project

### Ethers.js

- [ ] Adding support for a larger variety of networks, and making network-specific features isolated from the core; this allows non-Ethereum users to manage their own differences
- [ ] Part of this network feature isolation is that it facilitates better L2 support, since most L2 solutions behave similar to a normal network, but with their own internal differences
- [ ] With the plug-in support of ethers v6, there will also be more external plugins available, which also serve as a template for others to create their own plugins

---

## Q2

### DevEx & VM

- [ ] Better ZK Rollup L2 Support (depending on analysis from Q1)

### Hardforks & EIPs

- [ ] Iterations on the Merge HF library releases
- [ ] Eventually dedicated work on Merge HF improvement EIPs
- [ ] Continuation on Shanghai HF EIP implementations (scope still open)

- [ ] First prototype native JavaScript Verkle Tree implementation (depends on Q1 hire)

### Portal Network

- [ ] Stable communication with other clients for sub networks from Q1
- [ ] Draft implementation for 1-2 additional sub networks (e.g. tx / header gossip)
- [ ] Final decisions on browser networking topology
- [ ] Mid-scale browser syncing/communication experiments, feasibility study
- [ ] Establish partnership with one or more dapp/wallet providers to build a proof of concept integration that leverages Portal Network data in a real-world setting (e.g. replacing Infura with the Portal Network State Subnetwork for retrieving account balance data)
