# Welcome!

Thanks for visiting the EF JavaScript team resources. This is a choose-your-own-adventure; what's your goal?

### <a name="learn" />I'm here to learn the basics.

Ethereum's homepage, [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org), has a lot of great resources for getting off the ground.

This team also writes an [Ethereum 101 blog series](https://medium.com/ethereum-grid/ethereum-101-whats-a-blockchain-5a1e925963d7) that you may find useful.

### <a name="build" />I'm trying to build a dApp.

Traditional web applications are one JavaScript module away from communicating with the Ethereum blockchain. This team maintains two such packages, [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) and [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js). Choosing one over the other is a matter of personal preference, so check out each and decide which resonates best with you. You'll find tutorials leveraging each library at [ethereum.org/developers](https://ethereum.org/developers).

### <a name="contribute" />I'd like to contribute.

For now, each project has its own contribution tips:

- [EthereumJS](https://ethereumjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
- [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js#contributing)
- [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js#hacking-and-contributing)
- [Ethereum Grid](https://github.com/ethereum/grid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

In the future, we hope to standardize on more practices, making it easier to contribute to any of these tools.

### <a name="shrug" />How did I get here?

We're not sure, but we're sure glad you came. If you're looking for context, this page is maintained by the JavaScript team at the Ethereum Foundation. We contribute to a wide range of EF efforts, but are the primary maintainers of Web3.js, ethers.js, EthereumJS, and Ethereum Grid. You can learn more about these projects [here](/projects).
